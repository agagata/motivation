# Motivation booster

I made this site for myself to help me when I think I'm going crazy, because I feel overworked or overwhelmed with projects. Also, I wanted to teach myself JavaScript and jQuery.
It displays random element from database (which is just one small json file) which is supposed to make me feel better. It's not always something positive. Sometimes all I need is to look at things from perspective.
If it helps any other human being, that's awesome! But honestly, I only had myself in mind when I was creating this.

# How to contribute?

If you want to add some quote/video/music, I'll be more than happy to merge your awesome proposals. âœ¨

Take a look at database/motivation.json to see how the schema looks like.

What you should know:

1. Description is something that will appear in small letters underneath. It's optional for quotes.
2. Links have to have description. If the link become inactive, it will be easier for me to replace it.
3. Paste raw links to youtube. Make sure they are structured this way: **https://www.youtube.com/embed/**ZTLAx3VDX7g.
4. The same with music from spotify. Paste raw links and set type to "spotify".
5.  JS will take care of wrapping everything in html, so don't worry about it.
6.  You're great. ðŸ™Œ
